Sending response: Dylan Teehan is a first-year student in the BSc/MSc Immersive Software Engineering (ISE) program.  His skills encompass Java, Python, Object-Oriented Design, Django, Machine Learning Models, Git, data structures, databases, and Agile methodologies. He has practical experience in app and web development, and machine learning applications gained through coursework and personal projects.  He has participated in "The European Astro Pi Challenge" and the BT Young Scientist competition.  He emphasizes teamwork and possesses strong leadership and collaboration skills.

Dylan has developed the following projects:

1. **Better Alerts:** An LLM-powered web scraping tool that extracts data from publications, focusing on RSS feeds. It uses a dual-model approach with Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro to filter relevant articles related to Irish tech startups, addressing the limitations of Google Alerts.  The extracted data is then stored in Airtable.

2. **CVE-extractor:** A cybersecurity tool that extracts CVE numbers from articles using AI models, web scraping, and structured prompts. It features content extraction, RSS feed processing, Reddit post scraping, and a user-friendly GUI built with PyQT.  The tool supports multiple LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude APIs.

3. **Thymela (AI-Powered Meta-Studies):**  This project uses AI to extract metadata from text for ML stratification and data compatibility.  It features a hybrid search functionality (Dense Vector Search + Sparse Inverted Index and a Reranking Step) and is accessible through a Flask web app.  The project stores the extracted metadata in a database for future projects.

4. **Saoirse (Multi-Agent Systems):** A graphical user interface for creating, visualizing, and executing workflows composed of AI agents.  It includes a dynamic LLM wrapper supporting various AI models and a tool handling system. Features include a node editor, drag-and-drop interface, and save/load functionality for state machines.
